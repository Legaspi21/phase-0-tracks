# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

 *Version control is the process of keeping a log of all previous, parallel and modified versions of a project or code base so that changes can be made on a separate branch without interfering with the master or main branch. Version control is very useful in that it allows for a more painless collaboration and safer modifications to the master directory or code. A user can easily identify and test features without committing to the master and possibly breaking the code base. It allows for other developers to make contributions to the file and work simultaneously while easily keeping track of edits in separate branches that can be later merged into the master.*
   
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

 *A branch is a directory that contains the same files as the master and is used when a modification needs to be done without working directly on the master and jeopardizing the code base. A branch should be used **every** time any work is being done in the repository.*

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

 *A commit is a function of git used to accept changes to a given file. A good commit message provides a detailed explanation of what features were added or changed within the version.*

* What is a merge conflict?

 *A problem that arises when merging versions. In the event of a merge conflict the user may need to manually merge the versions to keep what they want from each.*
