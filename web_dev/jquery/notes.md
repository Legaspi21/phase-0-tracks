*Watch Videos*

I find that when learning a new topic I like to start with a broad video that explains what it is so I will watch a video about the basics of jQuery.

*Read*

After this I will look up and read some articles about jQuery.

*Watch More Videos*

I will watch another video or two depending related to what I discover in my reading.

*Practice/Tinker/Hack*

Last but not least I plan to get my hands dirty and fiddle around with what I have just learned. Primarily to experiment as I find this helps the concepts sink in.


###UPDATE

I found that the videos were the most helpful. One series in particular done by Travis Nielson at DevTips was especially enjoyable and actually got me going quite quickly. I really like the documentation for jQuery and find that because the community is so large there is plenty of resources out there to learn from.
