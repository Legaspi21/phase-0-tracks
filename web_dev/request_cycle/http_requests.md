### What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

A GET request is used to retrieve data and has no other effect. POST requests that a web server accept and store the data enclosed in the body of the request message. GET is used to retrieve a web page and POST is used to store data to a database or accept a comment or post to a page.

### Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

A cookie is a small piece of data stored in the users web browser. Cookies can be used to track browsing history, authenticate users and store data previously entered into form fields such as adresses, usernames, passwords and credit card numbers.
