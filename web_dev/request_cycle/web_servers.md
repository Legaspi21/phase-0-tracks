### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a virtual machine that acts as a server and runs a copy of an operating system. The advantages of using a VPS is that it costs less and since it is software based, one can be created in a short amount of time and destroyed equally fast.


### Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

You are more prone to bugs and risk losing your entire partition by running as root. The root user has too much power and should not be used except for doing administrative work.
